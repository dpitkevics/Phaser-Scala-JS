# Phaser JS facade for Scala JS

You can use it by cloning repository and adding to existing project.
See test directory for sample app using Phaser and completeng first tutorial from Phaser homepage.

I am sure there are a lot of things, that are incomplete. Added facades on things I used.

When I will learn how to publish this sbt project, I will do it, till then - clone github.
